### Story

"SOMEONES BEEN MURDERED, NOBODY LEAVES UNTIL THE MURDERER IS FOUND!"
You lock every room. No one can move through the rooms except you, because you have the key.

There's no way the victim could get into the pool
There are two keycards, janitor has one of them
So they would know where the card is kept, so it must be a murder
You start off with the keycard

### Mechanics
- Hour credit system, 8 hours to spend talking to people
- Each hour has 3 possible scenes you can choose, 36 scenes. Assuming the scenes are based on the hour. So 8 possible interactions per run. 36 options. 
	- A lot of work we wouldn't see if 36 scenes
- Alternative: Each character has x amount of scenes, each time you talk to them you get the next sequence.
- 5 people, 3 scenes, 15 total
