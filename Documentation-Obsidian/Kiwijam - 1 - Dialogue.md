### First branch
#### 1) Hour 1
You talk to the Marine Biologist
- MB: "This is absolutely terrible! I can't believe this is happening. I really hope the fish are going to be okay..."
- JC: "Did you see anything? Are you going to be okay?"
- MB: "Yeah I'm okay... I just hope the fish are going to be okay. The tanks, these are specialist tanks you know? A lot of money has been put into this. These fish were brought from all over the world, with enclosures made specifically for them. Yes sorry, no I didn't see anything. Just mingling with the crowd. Oh god, I bet they're going to go to that other awful aquarium. I bet it's all he's thinking about."
- "Who's thinking about the fish?"
- "That awful man over there in that awful turtle neck. Thinks he's some genius. He owns multiple businesses around town, including an aquarium. He even came up to me to show photos of the gift shop! I don't give a shit about your gift shop!"

- JC: "Did you know the victim?"
- RM: "Oh right, yes" *he adjusts his jacket* "Quite a shame. But I suppose that's what happens when you don't make safe investments".
- JC: "Safe investments?"
- RM: "Oh yes, he had this stupid idea that he could 'change the world!' shift society in a different more...'egalatarian' view... I suppose when you are just given wealth, then how could you respect it."
- JC: "Given wealth?"
- RM: "You *really* don't know much at all do you? Sorry who are you?"
- KC: "In the janitor, and I'm going to solve this mystery!"
- RM: "How quant. Well, his parents died and he inherited their wealth. Spending it everywhere. If he just took my advice and invested in other things he would have so much more to invest in his playthings. But oh well. Anyway, can't believe you broke the doors. Any chance I could get out?".
- KC: "Not until the killer is found"
- RM: "Well good luck with that"
- **Evidence shown: Present the card**
- JC: "Oh good you have my card. Fantastic. That strumpet Marine must of given it to you. I really can't believe she wore that dress. I really was trying to give her advice on a better one."
- RM: "Did you kill Phil to steal the fish?"
- JC: "Wow. Straight to the accusation? You really shouldn't show you card now. No. I didn't. Are you kidding me? Murder? How could I run my business at all from prison. Look, if you want my help, go talk to the manager. Have you even done that yet? I'm sure he would love to help. Can't imagine how he'd pay off his loan after this lot. Here, take these notes, I've been recording his finances and I have a few things to talk to him about."
