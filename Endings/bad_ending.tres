The loading bay door was opened from outside, by the delivery truck.

Everybody was free to go.

I picked up my mop. I had failed to catch the cuplrit, all that was left was to return to my job as janitor.

The police came by shortly.
They took the body away and did a brief dusting for fingerprints.

I later learned the result of their investigation:

They had ruled it an accident. They said the victim had fallen into the shark tank by mistake, and as a result had been eaten by the shark.

And so, the truth was hidden forever."
